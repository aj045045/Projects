This project is an **AI-powered plant disease detection system** that identifies diseases in plants using images and provides actionable solutions. The solution leverages a robust machine learning pipeline, real-time data streaming, model tracking, and natural language processing to create a scalable and intelligent plant health management system.

Inspired by and extended from this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aj045045/plant-predication), this project transforms a prototype into a production-ready application.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aj045045/project.git
cd plant-disease-detection
```

### 2. Set up the Environment

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Image Input**: User uploads an image of a plant leaf via Streamlit UI.
2. **Prediction Engine**: The image is passed to the TensorFlow model for classification.
3. **Kafka Pipeline**: The prediction is streamed and logged via Kafka.
4. **Solution Generator**: LangChain + Ollama generate a treatment plan using natural language.
5. **MLflow Tracking**: All model experiments and metrics are tracked and visualized.
6. **Display Output**: The result and treatment plan are shown on the frontend.
